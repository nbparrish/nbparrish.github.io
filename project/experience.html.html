<p style="color: hsla(308,94%,49%,1)">Hello, my name is Nikki Parrish and I reside in North  Carolina. I am a 29-year-old college student and I work full-time in the IT  field. I have decided to create a website where I can discuss different  self-care saving tips, and not just any tips but especially for young adults.  Young adults in college, trying to start a family, and even save for the  future. I believe self-care is very important in life but who says it must  break the bank? Not over here it doesn’t.</p>
<p><span style="color: hsla(136,93%,48%,1)">O</span><span style="color: hsla(127,93%,47%,1)">nce upon a time I got my nails done biweekly. It averages about  $150.00 a month and that’s not even including the pedicure. CHING CHANG. my  pockets were crying. I could never imagine my life without getting these things  I called my self-care and maintenance bi-weekly up keep. That was until I discover  press on nails and got myself a pedicure set for Christmas. You see when going  to the shop my nails would constantly break and lift which I have never  experience yet with the press on nails. These things were life changing. I was  able to do my own nails and toes in the comfort of my own home while sipping  some inexpensive wine. It was by far game changing for me. I save probably at  least $150.00 a month now that I can now use towards extra groceries thanks to  this inflation.</span> </p>
<p style="color: hsla(308,94%,50%,1)">&nbsp;Do my own pedi and medi?  NOT I! lol Right I said the same thing. It was so comfortable to sit back and  get pamper, but I’ll rather pamper myself while saving my pockets at the SAME  TIME! It does take time to get use too, but I have truly fallen in love with  having my self-care days in the comfort of my own home. Nail techs touch a lot  of hands and with the current virus going around you don’t have to worry about  catching&nbsp; it either. Another cool thing I discover that helps with stree is a personal sauna. I used to visit the sauna at least once a week now I can do it in the comfort of my own home while saying money. The last thing is working out outside, yes OUTSIDE. We need the Vitamin D and stop paying gym fees for a gym you will NEVER see.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
